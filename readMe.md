# Movie Recommendation System

In this project we are comparing two approaches for movie recommendation for a new user or existing user based on their age, gender and occupation.

We have implemented all the methods from scratch and tried to improve the existing movie recommender system.

### Approach 1: 
SVD-Collaborative Filtering
(Clustering existing users in the system and then recommending movies)

### Approach 2: 
k-clique method
(Clustering existing users in the system using connected graph and then recommending movies)


## Result:
RMSE value improved by 12% by using Approach-2 (K-clique method)
